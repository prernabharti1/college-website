<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>St. Mira’s College is an integral part of the Mira Movement in Education; it was founded in 1962 by the visionary philosopher-saint Sadhu T.L.Vaswani as the first college set up exclusively for women in Pune.</p>


<p>With justifiable pride, we wish to inform you that in the recent NAAC Reaccreditation process in March 2017, the college has earned an ‘A’ grade once more with a commendable score of 3.41 on a scale of 4. The prestigious India Today in its annual survey of the best three colleges in the city has, in its May 2017 issue, awarded the first position to the Arts and Science streams of St. Mira’s and the second position to its Commerce Stream. Recently, The Knowledge Reviewmagazine rated St Mira’s one of “The Best Private Institutes in India, November 2018”. This is an annual listing that acknowledges innovative and diverse educational procedures while preparing students to excel in various professional fields.</p>
